# Dongle Enclosure

As a final optional feature, you can add the ability to magnetically snap the dongle within the left keyboard and have it switch over to Bluetooth. This will use more battery but offers a good alternative when you don't want to plug in the dongle.

If you choose to do this, you will need the **3-pin magnetic pogo pins** mentioned in the optional parts, as they will allow your dongle to connect to the left side's battery when snapped in.

## Required Tools and Materials

For this part, you will require the following tools from the README. Ensure you use the correct soldering temperature for your solder (usually higher than 400°C is good). Cold joints will cause problems.

- Soldering iron (preferably with temperature control)
- Solder (preferably nothing larger than 0.8mm)
- Flux (optional but recommended)
- Tweezers
- Hot glue and a hot glue gun

## Assembling the Dongle

Start by assembling the dongle. You will need access to a 3D printer for this part unless you already 3D printed the dongle files during the Case Assembly step.

1. 3D print the **dongle.stl** and **dongle_cover.stl** files.
2. Properly remove all support material from your dongle 3D print.
3. Solder the **RAW** and **GND** pins of your dongle’s nice!nano to two pins on one of the magnetic connectors using wires.
4. Push the nice!nano towards the top of the dongle until it fits snugly.
5. Push the magnetic connector into the bottom hole (you might need to clip the supports on the sides to make it fit).

Your dongle should now function as it did before but will be enclosed in its housing. **Do not add the cover yet**, as it will make diagnosing problems difficult.

## Case Socket Connections

The left plate has an opening on the top right where the dongle is supposed to fit. We now need to add the other magnetic connector to the enclosure so the dongle clicks in and has secure electrical contacts.

1. Remove the keycaps from the left device (do not remove any switches), turn it off, and unscrew the plate from the base.
2. Flip the keyboard around and solder two wires to the **RAW** and **GND** pins on the back of the left keyboard's nice!nano.
3. Orient the other magnetic connector so it attracts the dongle's magnetic connector and does not repel it.
4. Solder the two wires soldered in step 2 to the same pins you soldered to the magnetic connector on the dongle.
5. Clip the supports on the magnetic connector so it fits in its enclosure.
6. Push the connector into its hole within the top plate.
7. Turn your left device on and slot the dongle into the opening.
8. Check that the dongle turns on (blue light flash) and appears as a Bluetooth device on your computer. If it does not, ensure your solder points are properly connected and that there are no broken or cold joints. Also, verify that your orientation matches on both ends and that you soldered the same pins to the corresponding pins.
9. If everything works correctly, remove the dongle from the enclosure and turn the left device off again.
10. Apply hot glue to the pins behind both magnetic connectors to ensure the connections do not move.
11. Glue the dongle cover onto the dongle.
12. Screw the base back onto the left device and reassemble it.

Congratulations! You should now have a dongle housing within your left keyboard that also allows your keyboard to interface via Bluetooth. Enjoy your Aurora build!
