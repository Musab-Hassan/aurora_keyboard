# Aurora Keyboard Build Guide

Before getting started, ensure you have fully read through the README.md file in the project root. Make sure you have all the required parts and tools before getting started.

This guide will cover how I built the keyboard and will provide the main steps however it expects you to already understand how mechanical keyboard work and have experience with soldering small components. If you decide to just go with the required soldering you will be fine with if you are comfortable using a soldering iron. The only part that requires exceptional hand soldering skills or a reflow station is if you choose to solder the SMD LEDs. They are exceptionally difficult to solder by hand however they are neither required nor recommended and are entirely optional.

This guide also expects that you made no changes to the pin layout on the nice!nano on each side and are going to use a 3rd nice!nano as a dongle. If you chose to not do these, you can still follow the guide but must [modify the ZMK config](https://github.com/Musab-Hassan/zmk-config-aurora/tree/main/config/boards/shields/aurora) for your keyboard to function properly.

Otherwise there is nothing else to it.

Let's build!
